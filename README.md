% Passing Reading: The percentage of students passing reading in the district.
Overall Passing Rate: The overall passing rate, calculated as the average of the % Passing Math and % Passing Reading.
School Summary:

School Name: The name of each school in the district.

A table highlighting the top 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate.
The table should include the same metrics as the School Summary.
Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate):

A table highlighting the bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate.
The table should include the same metrics as the School Summary.
Math Scores by Grade:

A table listing the average math score for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Reading Scores by Grade:

A table listing the average reading score for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Scores by School Spending:

A table that breaks down school performances based on average spending ranges per student.
The schools should be grouped into four reasonable spending bins.
The table should include the following metrics: average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and overall passing rate.
Scores by School Size:

A table that breaks down school performances based on school size (small, medium, large).
The table should include the following metrics: average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and overall passing rate.
Scores by School Type:

A table that breaks down school performances based on school type (charter vs. district).
The table should include the following metrics: average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and overall passing rate.
By analyzing and presenting these key metrics, you will provide valuable insights into school performance for the school board and mayor to make informed decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
